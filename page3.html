        Video Games has always been a hobby and an interest to me, because video games is a way I can connect with other people and make friends.
        I play video games as a way for me to relax and unwind from a long day whether its after school or over the weekend, gaming is also another way to pass the time whenever you're waiting for something during the day.
        My love for gaming started when I got an Xbox 360 for Christmas a very long time ago, I played games such as Halo 3, Halo Reach, Black Ops 2, Max Payne 3, Modern Warfare 3, and even Dark Souls. Soon I knew that gaming would be one of my hobbies.
        It wasn't long after that I got another gaming console in Christmas of 2014, the Xbox One. Getting the Xbox One further made enjoy gaming as I enjoyed gaming titles such as Titanfall, Dark Souls 3, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, and more. It is because of gaming I met a lot of people throughout my life that share the same interests as me,
        we would spend times talking about our favorite video games and why its they're favorite, but it also got into a video game design class in High Schoo, which was also an origin of how coding became one of my interests, but I'll get to coding later on a different page.
        Like I said, video games has always been a hobby since growing up, and I don't think anything could change that.
